# CD Media Database

This app enables the user to create an account and log into their own personal CD Media Database.  Users can create, add, delete, and edit their entries making this a Full Crud application.  This app allows users to enter the following properties of each of their audio CDs.

1. Artist
2. Album
3. Top 4 Favorite Tracks
4. Link to the Album Art
5. Conditon 
6. Packaging Type

I came up with the idea to create this application based on my ever growing CD library.  I went shopping for more CDs and ended up buying duplicate titles which can become expensive after a few duplicate purchases

The Technologies used in this project are javascript node.js json CSS and Model-View-Controller (MVC) Framework.

In the future, I plan on adding the ability to add the full track listing of each entry.  Also, another update will include the Genre catagory. The ability to search by artist, album, track, and genre will also be added in the future.  Keep your eyes and ears open for further updates.

The following is a link to my Trello board which shows the planning stages of my project.
